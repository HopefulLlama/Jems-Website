			<p>Since I could hold a crayon, pencil or brush, I have attempted to cover more than my fair share of the world's supply of paper products with drawings, paintings and cartoons.</p>
			<p>After school and college, I worked for a national museum on exhibitions and graduated to working in graphic design studios. After a few years as a freelance illustrator and designer I worked for a local authority design unit for ten years, until I again dipped my toe into the freelance world.</p>
			<p>Regardless of where I have worked in design, I have never stopped illustrating, painting and selling graphic work.</p>
			<p>This web site is an attempt to reach a wider audience to allow me to do more of what I love to do - design, paint and cartoon.</p>
			<p>If you are interested in commissioning a work, either design or illustration, no matter the subject or style, please get in contact as I love a challenge - Email: <a href="mailto:info@jemsoar.com">info@jemsoar.com</a></p>
			<p>Thanks for visiting the site. I hope you will find something to interest you.</p>
